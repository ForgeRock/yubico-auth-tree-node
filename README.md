### WebAuthn

ForgeRock Access Management supports WebAuthn, enabling FIDO2 hardware devices, such as the YubiKey, for strong authentication.

WebAuthn also offers users greater choice for authentication, including:

* Strong single-factor (passwordless)
* Two-factor (2FA)
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

With FIDO2 and WebAuthn, ForgeRock Access Management and the YubiKey can replace a username and password with a much stronger form of single factor authentication. FIDO2 and WebAuthn use public-key cryptography and origin  bound key validation instead of passwords or weaker forms of authentication like SMS. The cryptographic security model eliminates the risks of account takeovers from phishing, and all forms of password theft and replay attacks. 

The joint ForgeRock and YubiKey solution also enables expanded use cases, allowing users to also leverage the YubiKey as a second factor for authentication, or combine it with an additional factor, such as a PIN or biometric gesture, to enable strong multi-factor authentication.
